# Probing 

Simple definition that creates a probing routing that probes along the xaxis. I'm using this on my desktop machine with a custom probe. I'll circle back in near future and add more info and examples. For now I'll leave this with GIF of probing and result. I hand-held a small 3D printed block on a portion of the extrusion to make the result more diverse.
