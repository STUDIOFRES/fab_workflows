# fab_workflows

A currated collection of documented workflows for going from virtual to physical. Most examples lives inside of [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com) and renders its output to [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com). So far this looks like this: 

## Creating Geometry
- Object along curve
- Using the graph tool

## Other things

- Using Websockets to talk to things outside of Rhino / Grasshopper
