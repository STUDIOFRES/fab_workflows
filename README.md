A currated collection of documented workflows for going from virtual to physical. Most examples lives inside of [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com) and renders to [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com). So far this looks like this: 

## Creating Geometry
- [Object along curve](https://github.com/STUDIOFRES/fab_workflows/tree/master/resources/basics/00_basics_object_along_curve)
- [Using the graph tool](https://github.com/STUDIOFRES/fab_workflows/tree/master/resources/basics/01_basics_graph_tool)

## Creating Patterns
- [Circle Grids](https://github.com/STUDIOFRES/fab_workflows/tree/master/resources/patterns/01_pattern_circle_grid)

## Other things

- [Using Websockets to talk to things outside of Rhino / Grasshopper](https://github.com/STUDIOFRES/fab_workflows/tree/master/resources/coms)
- [Creating toolpaths and gcode with Grasshopper](https://github.com/STUDIOFRES/fab_workflows/tree/master/gcode)
