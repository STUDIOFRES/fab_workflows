# Experiments in foldable geometry

Overall goal; going from 3D geometry, to 2D geometry for fast and easy fabrication, and finally back to 3D by folding fabricated elements. We are starting out in cheap and accessible materials like cardboard and paper, with a final target of using more high performance materials like POM, PETG or sheet metal.
